# Loading Skalaton Reusable Component

This repository demonstrates a code to create a reusable component of the loading skeleton which you can build once and use across your app. 

	â€¢ Utilized expo for creating new react native project.
        â€¢ This reusable code also used for bare react native project as logic remains same.
	â€¢ Utilized expo-linear-gradient and react-native-reanimated v3 to create a loading skeleton.
	â€¢ Added a reusable component for pulse and shiver animation.
